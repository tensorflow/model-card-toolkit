        <p>
        Model Card Toolkit (MCT) is a collection of tools and resources that support developers in
        compiling the information that goes into <a href="https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about"><Model Cards</a>
        and aids in the creation of interfaces that will be useful for different audiences.
        <br>
        To guide the Model Card creator to organize model information, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/model-card-toolkit/blob/master/model_card_toolkit/schema/v0.0.1/model_card.schema.json">JSON schema</a>
        , which specifies the fields to include in the Model Card. Using the model provenance
        information stored with ML Metadata (MLMD), MCT automatically populates the JSON with
        relevant information, such as class distributions in the data and model performance
        statistics.
        <br>
        We also provide a ModelCard data API to represent an instance of the JSON schema
        and visualize it as a Model Card. The Model Card creator can choose which metrics and graphs
        to display in the final Model Card, including metrics that highlight areas where the modelâ€™s
        performance might deviate from its overall performance, leading to fairness concerns.</p>
