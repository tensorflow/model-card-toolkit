        The Model Card Toolkit (MCT) library streamlines and automates generation of
        <a href="https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about">Model Cards</a>, machine learning
        documents that provide context and transparency into a model's development and performance.
        Integrating the Model Card Toolkit into your ML pipeline will allow you to share your
        model's metadata and metrics with researchers, developers, reporters, and more.
        <br>
        <br>
        MCT stores model card fields using a
        <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/model-card-toolkit/blob/master/model_card_toolkit/schema/v0.0.1/model_card.schema.json">JSON schema</a>.
        MCT can automatically populate those fields for TFX users via
        <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd">ML Metadata (MLMD)</a>. Model card
        fields can also be manually populated via a
        <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/model_card_toolkit/api_docs/python/model_card_toolkit">Python API</a>.
        Some use cases of model cards include:
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px">
          <li>
            Facilitating the exchange of information between model builders and product developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Informing users of ML models to make better-informed decisions about how to use them (or how not to use them).
          <li>
            Providing model information required for effective public oversight and accountability.
          </li>
        </ul>
